For PATH convenience, in ~/.bashrc:
alias startconda='export PATH=~/"anaconda3/bin:$PATH"'

Test the software! We need to create a series of test cases, especially as
we don't have any automated tests.

To build and release a new version:
bumpversion --new-version XX.YY.ZZ  or  bumpversion patch (or minor / major)
rm -rf dist build && python setup.py bdist_wheel sdist && twine upload -u __token__ dist/*
git push --tags

To build the conda package (after the above):
conda-build --numpy=1.17 conda
Follow the instructions to upload
conda build clean


To only build and pip-install the package locally, use
./inst-local.sh

To make icons if you haven't already:
oct_make_icons
